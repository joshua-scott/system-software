 Task description:
Code a doubly linked list of structs. Each struct is an element in the periodic table.
Each struct contains the element's name (e.g. Hydrogen), chemical symbol (e.g. H), atomic number (e.g. 1) and state (liquid, solid, gas, unknown)
Each struct shall also contain a pointer to the next element and a pointer to the previous element
You shall be able to add new elements to the list (either read user input or from a file)
New elements shall go to correct place in the list based on their atomic number
You shall be able to find an element by using the chemical symbol as a key
You shall be able to print out the element's information
You shall be able to print out the elements that currently exist periodic table
You shall be able to empty the whole list and free the memory
Use pointers and functions and allocate memory dynamically for each element
